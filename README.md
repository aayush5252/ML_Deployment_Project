# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification — End-to-End ML Deployment with Streamlit

Welcome to the **Iris Flower Classification App** 🌿 — an end-to-end **Machine Learning + Streamlit** project that predicts the type of Iris flower based on user inputs.  
This project brings data science to life by combining model building, interactive UI, and real-time predictions — all in one simple web app.

---

## ✨ What This App Does

Enter the **Sepal Length**, **Sepal Width**, **Petal Length**, and **Petal Width**, and the model will:
- 🌺 Predict the **species** of the flower — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*
- 📊 Display **prediction probabilities** beautifully as a **bar chart**
- 🧠 Demonstrate a complete ML workflow from training to deployment

---

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

- Dataset used: [Iris dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
- Model built using: **scikit-learn**
- Trained & tested using standard ML workflow:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature selection
  - Model training and evaluation
- Deployed using: **Streamlit**
